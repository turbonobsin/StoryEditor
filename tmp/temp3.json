You slowly take in your surroundings and realize you are in your resting quarters, but it does not feel right. It is oddly quiet, you work on the Celestial Voyager, one of the biggest touring ships across the galaxy, and yet you don't hear any commotion. Just the faint hum of the lights overhead, but besides that this absence of sound is unsettling, to say the least. Something is wrong, that is for certain, and you need to get out of here, and find help. Exiting out of your personal Quarters, into the hallway, you are greeted with an unfamiliar scene. Instead of a list of doors for everyone else's quarters, you are instead treated with a hallway that just leads to darkness towards your right, and looking towards the left leads towards a singular door.

Some of the paint peeled revealing the underpainting beneath, a reddish-orange that has also faded from age. Hesitantly, you reach for the door handle, which juts out similar to an old pull handle. Your fingers curl around its rim before you slowly pull open the door. You are greeted by a dark room; reaching around, your hand grazes that of a light switch, and you can finally see. A simplistic bathroom greets you– one of many for the Lower Deck. Its green hues are a significant contrast to the earlier warm tones of the hallway. ",

You are truly alone, and not wanting to charge blindly into the darkness, you cautiously near the weird box. Picking it up, the casting light moves, illuminating briefly the area around you. Examining the odd source, it resembles something similar to a lantern (if that is even what it is called). You remember seeing these during your Earth Civilization classes when you were in high school, but seeing it in person is a different experience. Why is it here on this ship? How does it even work? Looking at it, there is a latch containing the light within, and as you reach inside you flinch suddenly back at the scorching heat of the oil splashing onto your hand. The lantern seems to function off of a wick in the center, fueled by oil, its heat casts a soft warm light that gives you a small amount of vision in front of you. Making sure not to burn yourself again, you carefully hold out the lantern in front of you, illuminating further down the hallway. You start to walk down the corridor and you see a door on your right. You hold up the lantern and inspect further. You find a shiny gold plaque on the door that reads “Maintenance”. You have seen this room before, but how can you be sure the same contents lie behind the door in front of you? You shine the lantern further down the hallway noticing the vast voidless space before you. The end of the hallway is unknown as the lantern only illuminates a few extra feet in front of you. Your heart beating fast and your hands shake, you are not sure which path to take.  ",

The air within is dry as you enter the boiler room, it is dark and the only light source is the cast of lights through the foggy windows from the stellar luminances from outside. The boiler room was where some of the lowest workers had to go. You thought you had it bad, but you remember when there was a malfunction and Sarah had gotten burned by the steam as they were attempting to fix the piping on block A. It’s a big room full of three giant tankers, each constantly filtering water through its system as it traveled through the maze of pipes lining the wall. With barely any walk room, you slide yourself between two pipes, navigating yourself around the giant tankers. As you walked through the facility, it was clear that there was no sign of life within the room, yet you could not help but feel as if you were being watched. It felt uneasy, and as you ducked underneath a series of pipes running into the third tanker, suddenly, a violent hiss escaped into the air as steam burst out from one of the pipes near you. Startled momentarily, you gather yourself and make it across. There is no way the person ran through here, and you eventually make it through the series of pipes and across the other side of the room. You are greeted by an old rusted door and go to open it, the hinges squeak as the door slowly slides open and you are greeted by a bright light",

You have never been down this sector and tended to avoid the two rooms after all the bad stories you heard about them. The room is huge, with towering ceilings reaching up into the darkness above. The floors and walls have a similar metallic design as the hallway, but what really impresses you is what takes up the center. Three colossal engines dominate the center, their sleek metallic surfaces humming with energy. Well all except the one on the far right, it looks perhaps damaged, but you are unsure. Thick cables snake across the floor, creating the most elaborate tripping hazards. These cables connect to the engines in a variety of ways and work their way into the walls around you. Your eyes finally pull away from the grand scene and notice a door in the back of the room and a door on the far side. ",

Entering, your small sliver of hope is sadly crushed as you are hit with reality again. The space is a symphony of metal and monitors. Gears and cogs line parts of the wall, and you see blueprints laid out displaying past designs about the engine room. Analyzing all of this briefly, you realize this is a little over your pay rate…if you are even still getting paid?? However, if you could fix the engine, it would cause a brief stir, and maybe someone would come down. Not only that but it might fix some of the problems occurring on the ship. ",

To get you away, away from this horrific scene. You can feel a chill run down your spine as reality sets in, something terrible is truly happening on this ship. Your feet move like they have a mind of their own, dragging you back and away from the scene. As you step back, expecting to reenter the Engine Room, you instead feel your back against a wall. Turning around you notice the door you came through is gone! Realizing you have nowhere else to go you turn back around, stomaching the brutal site, and you press on. You head down the hallway at a much slower pace than earlier and notice a door near the end of the hall on the right side. At this point, you do not know where you are and could see what lies beyond the door, or could continue down the hallway. \n",

Inside you are greeted by an equally well-furnished living room, though unlike the other room, this room clearly has not seen life in some time. It is a square-shaped room with dark-stained wooden walls. In the center is an L-shaped brown-colored couch taking a majority of the walk room. In front of the couch is a giant painting of a man wearing a similar uniform as yourself, but the clothing seems slightly different. It has several more patches across his arm, and along with the emblem sewn across his right breast is also the letter W below the emblem. Beneath the painting is a small set of bookcases housing a number of books. There is something also sitting on top of the bookcase. Going left from the bookcase is an archway leading into another room, and there is also another archway in the far left corner of the room. ",

You jump to the side, your gaze looking upward as you brace yourself for imminent danger, fearing the ceiling might collaspe at any moment.\nYou look back at the cell and see that along with the man’s dissapearance, the shiny card has also vanished. You believe that shiny card might be the answer to getting up to the ship’s next level, but you have no idea where he could have gone, or if he was even there in the first place.\n Panic tightens its grip around your chest and you feel your hands go numb. Can you even be sure the man was ever there. The incessant clunking from above only serves to strengthen your agitation. Another loud clunk rains down from above. Again you throw your hand over your head and skid over to the door, believing this time the ceiling really would collapse. You have to get upstairs, but nothing you have will help you now. You must keep searching for the key, but this noise is driving you crazy.\n",

Following the noise leads you down the jail hall to an old door, its weathered frame adorned with rusted bars. You reach for the knob and with unsettling ease it opens, making you further question the security system.  Stepping inside you are greeted by a larger cell. Unlike the ones you had seen earlier, this one must have been designed to keep something big within. The floor is similar to the concrete floor from earlier, and the walls are old with light gray paint seeming to have faded significantly. \nYour attention is drawn to the middle, the heart of the chamber that commands your attention. Something you have never seen before, it’s disgusting and horrid, yet you cannot take your eyes off it. A purple-like substance lines the far corner walls and takes up the majority of the jail cell. It’s piled decently high (exceeding your ankles), and you can only describe it as a sort of sludge. In the middle of the pile looks similar to that of an ooze-like hand, holding a familiar sight, the keycard. You have to approach it.\n",

From the giant purple substance, many long slimy-like tendrils extend out of it, making contact with the walls as it pulls itself across. You know you have no choice but to use the Torch, turning around while pulling the trigger, a familiar hum begins to emanate from the weapon. You are unsure how many more times you can use it, but you do know that it packs a punch. This time bracing yourself, releases and you get a clear look at it. It launches a bright projectile that phases through a part of the monster, and in an instant, that section of the creature vanishes. As if it was never there it leaves a “U” like impression on the creature. Where the mass vanishes begins to ungulate and convulse as it slowly regenerates what it lost. The creature has stopped in its tracks as it slowly regains its form.",
