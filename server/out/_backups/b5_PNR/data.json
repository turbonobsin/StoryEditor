What time is it? An intense ringing pulses through your head as you slowly stumble to your feet. You slowly take in your surroundings and realize you are in your resting quarters, but it does not feel right. It is oddly quiet, you work on the Celestial Voyager, one of the biggest touring ships across the galaxy, and yet you don't hear any commotion. Just the faint hum of the lights overhead, but besides that this absence of sound is unsettling, to say the least. Something is wrong, that is for certain, and you need to get out of here, and find help. Exiting out of your personal Quarters, into the hallway, you are greeted with an unfamiliar scene. Instead of a list of doors for everyone else's quarters, you are instead treated with a hallway that just leads to darkness towards your right, and looking towards the left leads towards a singular door.

Your fingers curl around its rim before you slowly pull open the door. You are greeted by a dark room; reaching around, your hand grazes that of a light switch, and you can finally see.

You are truly alone, and not wanting to charge blindly into the darkness, you cautiously near the weird box. Picking it up, the casting light moves, illuminating briefly the area around you. Examining the odd source, it resembles something similar to a lantern (if that is even what it is called). You remember seeing these during your Earth Civilization classes when you were in high school, but seeing it in person is a different experience. Why is it here on this ship? How does it even work? Looking at it, there is a latch containing the light within, and as you reach inside you flinch suddenly back at the scorching heat of the oil splashing onto your hand. The lantern seems to function off of a wick in the center, fueled by oil, its heat casts a soft warm light that gives you a small amount of vision in front of you. Making sure not to burn yourself again, you carefully hold out the lantern in front of you, illuminating further down the hallway. You start to walk down the corridor and you see a door on your right. You hold up the lantern and inspect further. You find a shiny gold plaque on the door that reads “Maintenance”. You have seen this room before, but how can you be sure the same contents lie behind the door in front of you? You shine the lantern further down the hallway noticing the vast voidless space before you. The end of the hallway is unknown as the lantern only illuminates a few extra feet in front of you.

The air within is dry as you enter the boiler room, it is dark and the only light source is the cast of lights through the foggy windows from the stellar luminances from outside. The boiler room was where some of the lowest workers had to go. You thought you had it bad, but you remember when there was a malfunction and Sarah had gotten burned by the steam as they were attempting to fix the piping on block A. It’s a big room full of three giant tankers, each constantly filtering water through its system as it traveled through the maze of pipes lining the wall. With barely any walk room, you slide yourself between two pipes, navigating yourself around the giant tankers. As you walked through the facility, it was clear that there was no sign of life within the room, yet you could not help but feel as if you were being watched. It felt uneasy, and as you ducked underneath a series of pipes running into the third tanker, suddenly, a violent hiss escaped into the air as steam burst out from one of the pipes near you. Startled momentarily, you gather yourself and make it across. There is no way the person ran through here, and you eventually make it through the series of pipes and across the other side of the room.

Three colossal engines dominate the center, their sleek metallic surfaces humming with energy. Well all except the one on the far right, it looks perhaps damaged, but you are unsure. Thick cables snake across the floor, creating the most elaborate tripping hazards. These cables connect to the engines in a variety of ways and work their way into the walls around you.
